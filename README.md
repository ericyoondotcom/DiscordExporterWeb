# DiscordExporterWeb
Export Discord message history, all through a webpage.

## Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by [Tyrrrz](https://github.com/Tyrrrz)'s C#-based [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter). I decided a web version would be a significant improvement over the author's project, as:
- The C# project has since been put into maintenance mode
- Users must install the .NET Framework to use the C# project
- I wanted a cross-platform web interface

Massive kudos to the author of DiscordChatExporter, Tyrrrz, for their incredible work, and make sure to [check them out on Github](https://github.com/Tyrrrz)!
